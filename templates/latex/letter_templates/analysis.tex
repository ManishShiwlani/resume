I enjoy working with data and presenting it well.
Some examples of my visualizations can be seen in my Masters thesis, which I have linked in my r\'{e}sum\'{e}.

I am experienced with fast-paced development, and use best practices such as testing, documentation, and version control.
I also enjoy automating processes whenever possible, as well as finding and fixing bugs.
