I did my undergad in Mechatronics engineering, where I tried to focus on the physical aspect of robotics.
As such, I had six co-op internships, from administration to research, from electronics to designing bicycles and industrial machines using Solidworks.
For courses, I used C, C++, Matlab, Simulink, Labview, and Allen Bradley PLC, among others.

I also did my masters in a robotics lab where most of my work was programming-related.
I controlled robots both using my own infrastructure and with ROS, and have used other packages for analysis and visualization.

My main language nowadays is Python, but I also have experience in embedded programming with C and C++ (on AVR, Arduino, and mbed), as well as some ladder logic, signal processing and controls.
I enjoy controlling machines, and have written device drivers in C++<11 and Python.
I always use version control, write clean and maintainable code, and try to test as much as I can.
I even have two packages on PyPI, with a possible third coming by early next year for analysis of manipulators with known DH-parameters or Forward Kinematics matrices.
