I did my undergad in mechatronics engineering in Canada, where I tried to focus on the physical aspect of robotics.
As such, over two years, I had six co-op internships in three countries, from research to administration, from electronics to designing bicycles and industrial machines using Solidworks.
In my courses, I used C, C++, Matlab, Simulink, Labview, and Allen Bradley PLC, among others. Some of my courses were about mechatronic systems, electromechanical machine design, as well as microprocessor systems and design.

I did my masters in a robotics lab in Kyoto where most of my work was programming-related.
I programmed and controlled robots and drones using both my own infrastructure and with ROS, and have used other packages for analysis and visualization.
More recently, I have been teaching myself machine learning, and I was working as a data scientist and Python developer with Sentiance in Antwerp.

My main language nowadays is Python---I even have two packages on PyPI--- but I also have experience in embedded programming with C and C++ on various chips, as well as some ladder logic, signal processing and controls.
I have been using Linux since 2009 (and OSX from last year).
I enjoy controlling machines, and have written device drivers in C++<11 and Python.
I always use version control, write clean and maintainable code, and try to test as much as I can.
