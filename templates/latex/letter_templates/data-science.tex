I did my undergrad in Mechatronics engineering, and my masters in a robotics lab.
I have been programming since 2006, and on Linux since 2009.
I have used a variety of programming languages for my courses, but I have primarily been using Python (including the Scipy stack) for the past four years.

I always use version control, write clean and maintainable code, and try to follow best practices in terms of documentation and testing.
I enjoy automating processes whenever possible, as well as finding and fixing bugs.
I also have two packages on PyPI, with a possible third coming by early next year for robot analysis.

I am extremely interested in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, and am currently taking courses online.
