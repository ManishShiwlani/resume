I did my undergrad in mechatronics engineering in Canada, where I did six co-op internships in three countries over two years.
After that, I did my masters in a robotics lab in Japan.
There, I programmed and controlled robots and drones, and used various technologies to visualize the data collected.
Since graduating, I have been teaching myself machine learning, and have moved to Antwerp to work with Sentiance as a data scientist and Python developer. 

I have been programming since 2006, and on Linux since 2009.
I have used a variety of programming languages for my work and courses, but I have primarily been using Python (including Jupyter and the Scipy stack) since 2014. I even have two packages on PyPI.

I always use version control, write clean and maintainable code, and try to follow best practices in terms of documentation and testing.
I enjoy automating processes whenever possible, as well as finding and fixing bugs.
