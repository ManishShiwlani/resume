        I love working in multidisciplinary, international teams.
        I have a bachelors in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Waterloo in Canada.
        During that time, I completed six internships in three different countries, for a total of two years of work experience.
        In addition, I spent three years at the Mechatronics Laboratory in Japan's Kyoto University, graduating with a Masters in Mechanical Engineering.

        I also enjoy languages, and am currently learning German, my eighth.
        If I move to Veldhoven, I do not think I should have a problem learning Dutch as well.

        My objective there was to create a new interface for a single-camera drone which improved the pilot's situational awareness.
        After development, I conducted experiments to test whether my method was better than simply using the first-person view.

        I analyzed the results in a Jupyter Notebook, primarily using Pandas and Seaborn, two Python packages, producing hundreds of plots in the preliminary phase.
        Bayesian Analysis Supersedes the T-Test (BEST) was performed to evaluate the quantitative difference between the methods,
        and simple t-testing was used for comparing the surveys.

        I discovered that my proposed method was indeed better than the default.
        I also found that tester performance was increasing with each subsequent run, and that there was also a difference depending on which method they started with.
        This led me to recommend that further experiments be run with a longer practice session, and that the testers make more flights for each method.
